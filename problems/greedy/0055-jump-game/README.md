## 문제 설명

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` *if you can reach the last index, or* `false` *otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`
